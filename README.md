# practice-rust

## Lesson 1
* Gone through the [rust-lang first section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
* Used `rustc hello.rs` and `./hello` to compile and execute the `hello_world` example
* Used `cargo new`, `cargo build`, and `cargo run` to create the `hello_cargo` example
* Added `/**/target/` in root directory's `.gitignore` to avoid committing binary files (this will only work for projects created via `cargo`, otherwise the binary file won't be under `target` folder)
